# Restaurant-Waiting-List-System
A C program that will implement a customer waiting list that might be used by a restaurant. 
When people want to be seated in the restaurant, they give their name and group size to the 
host/hostess and then wait until those in front of them have been seated. The program must 
use a linked list to implement the queue-like data structure.
